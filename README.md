# Style Guide for My Bucket List application

This is the style guide for **My** Bucket List application. This is the final project for the first course ("HTML and CSS") of the [**EPFL Extension School**](https://exts.epfl.ch/)'s [_Web Application Development Program_](https://exts.epfl.ch/courses-programs/web-application-development).

This project was developed by [_Laura Elena Gómez_](https://github.com/elenagoto), and was sumbmitted and approved in October 2019.

**Notes for this version:**

This project had been already submited and approved in my previous enrollement in the program. For all the previous commitments please refer to the [old Github repository](https://github.com/epfl-extension-school/project-wad-c1-s13-764).

The changes and additions in this version are:

- Corrected margin problems that were forcing a horizontal scrolling.
- Added missing viewport metadata to the style guide pages.
- Added extra enhancement to the _goal_ organism by adding a feature query with `@supports (display: grid)`.

The responsive desing can also be tested using the following URL:
